## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a specialized documentation management platform with an importance score of 75/100, focusing on four core components:

## Document Management System
- Custom versioning system for documentation control
- Markdown extraction engine with intelligent source parsing
- Multi-origin document sharing with normalized URLs
- GitHub-integrated document editing workflow
- Action tracking with user notifications

## Navigation Architecture
- Domain-specific hierarchical content organization
- Type-based content routing and mapping
- Section-based grouping with active state management
- Multi-level navigation rules

## Content Structure Control
Enforces a three-level document hierarchy:
1. Section index requirements
2. Subsection organization rules
3. Leaf content structure validation

## Content Protection System
Implements a three-tier spoiler system:
- Inline sensitive content protection
- Block-level content masking
- Leaf-level content security
- Accessibility-compliant reveal mechanisms

The system's value proposition centers on enforcing strict documentation structure while maintaining content flexibility through custom processing rules and specialized content protection features.
