description: Defines rules and implementation for hierarchical documentation navigation, route mapping, and section organization

# navigation-structure

The navigation system implements a strict three-level hierarchical documentation structure with specialized routing and mapping rules:

## Core Navigation Components

### Documentation Section Mapping
Path: src/scripts/sidebars.ts
- Enforces three distinct navigation levels for all documentation content
- Maps numeric prefixed content folders (01-getting-started) to clean URLs (/getting-started)
- Handles section aliases and redirects for legacy paths
Importance Score: 75/100

### Route Structure Validation
Path: scripts/check-route-structure.js
- Validates bidirectional mapping between content files and route definitions
- Enforces constraints between parent/child sections in the hierarchy
- Ensures consistent route naming across all navigation levels
Importance Score: 70/100

## Navigation Hierarchy Rules

1. Level 1: Main Categories
   - Top-level documentation sections
   - Must contain at least one child section
   - Cannot contain direct content

2. Level 2: Sub-sections
   - Groups related documentation topics
   - Can contain both content and child sections
   - Must have a valid parent section

3. Level 3: Content Pages
   - Individual documentation pages
   - Must belong to a Level 2 section
   - Cannot have child sections

The navigation structure maps folder-based content organization to URL-friendly routes while maintaining strict hierarchical relationships between sections.
