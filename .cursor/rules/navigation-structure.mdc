# navigation-structure

The navigation system implements a strictly enforced three-level hierarchy designed specifically for AI/ML documentation organization:

## Core Navigation Rules (Score: 85)
- Enforces exactly 3 levels of documentation depth
- Maps numeric prefixed content folders to clean URLs
  Example: `01-fish-talks/` → `/fish-talks`
- Requires index.md/index.astro pattern at Level 1
- Enforces subfolder structure at Level 2
- Prohibits nesting beyond Level 3

## Route Validation (Score: 75)
Located in `scripts/check-route-structure.js`:
- Validates content/route pairs based on AI documentation patterns
- Maps AI documentation sections using numeric prefixes for ordered presentation
- Enforces section-specific sidebar navigation rules

## Section Organization (Score: 70)
Located in `src/scripts/sidebars.ts`:
- Implements domain-specific section aliases
- Defines AI/ML content organization patterns
- Handles mapping between internal section IDs and public routes
- Maintains strict hierarchical relationships between documentation sections

## Navigation Components
Path Structure:
```
docs/
  ├── section-1/        # Level 1 (requires index)
  │   ├── topic-a/      # Level 2 (enforced subfolder)
  │   │   └── page.md   # Level 3 (content only)
  │   └── topic-b/
  └── section-2/
```
