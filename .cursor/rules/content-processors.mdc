## Primary Components

### Spoiler System (Importance Score: 85)
Implements domain-specific content hiding mechanisms with three distinct types:

1. Inline Spoilers
- Handles single-line text concealment
- Processes custom syntax markers for hidden content
- Maps to specialized rendering components

2. Block Spoilers 
- Manages multi-line content blocks
- Preserves nested markdown structures
- Enforces content organization rules

3. Leaf Spoilers
- Handles terminal content nodes
- Prevents further nesting within spoiler blocks
- Maintains strict hierarchy constraints

### Custom Syntax Processing (Importance Score: 80)
Domain-specific content transformations:

1. Directive Handling
- Custom spoiler syntax interpretation
- Content block boundary detection
- Type-specific processing rules

2. Content Structure
- Three-level processing hierarchy
- Strict enforcement of nesting rules
- Specialized handling for technical documentation

### Content Organization (Importance Score: 75)
Enforces documentation-specific processing rules:

1. Hierarchy Management
- Validates processing depth levels
- Enforces content boundary rules
- Maps processing directives to rendering components

2. Content Validation
- Verifies directive syntax compliance
- Ensures proper nesting structure
- Maintains processing chain integrity
