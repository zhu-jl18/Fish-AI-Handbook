## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The documentation management system consists of five core business components that handle specialized content organization and navigation:

## Documentation Navigation System
Located in `src/scripts/sidebars.ts`, implements a three-level hierarchical documentation structure with specialized mapping between numeric-prefixed content folders and URL-friendly routes. Importance: 75/100

## Content Relationship Management
Handles strict content organization rules through `scripts/check-route-structure.js`, enforcing bidirectional mapping between content and routes while maintaining a rigid three-level hierarchy constraint. Importance: 70/100

## Table of Contents Generation
Provides specialized heading management through `src/scripts/toc.ts` with custom slug generation supporting Chinese/English mixed content and scroll-spy navigation features. Importance: 65/100

## Contributor Management System
Manages AI model contributor relationships in `src/config/site.ts` with predefined metadata mappings and threshold-based display logic. Importance: 60/100

## Document Processing Pipeline
Implements documentation-specific validation through `scripts/lint-markdown-code-blocks.mjs` with custom rules for code blocks and multilingual content validation. Importance: 55/100

The system interconnects these components to provide:
- Hierarchical documentation organization
- Bilingual content support
- AI contributor tracking
- Custom navigation patterns
- Documentation-specific validation
